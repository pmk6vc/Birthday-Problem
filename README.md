# Birthday-Problem

My quick Java implementation of the Birthday Problem, which represents finding the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a set of N people. The program allows the user to choose how many people to put in a room, and the number of trials to run the simulation. For each trial, each person is assigned a random number from 1 to 365 to represent his/her birthday. A trial is a "success" if at least two numbers match. The program prints the proportion of "successful" trials from the specified number of trials. It also prints the expected value for this success rate by using basic probability theory.

The motivation for this program was simply because I thought the mathematical result was kind of mind-boggling. I wrote this program to "see" the result in action for myself via simulation.
